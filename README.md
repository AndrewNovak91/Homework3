Homework 3 - Password Generator

Task: Create a website using HTML, CSS, Javascript. A password will randomly be generated based on criteria that the user provides when prompted.

Upon clicking the button labeled "Generate Password", the user will be prompted for a password length between 8-128. If outside that range, the user is prompted to once again enter a password of the correct range. This will loop until the correct character limit is reached.

The script then prompts the user to define if they would like to include numbers, characters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. If the user selects none to all criteria, the program will ask it to select at least each one and will loop back through the prompts.

When all parameters have been defined, the password will appear within the password box.
